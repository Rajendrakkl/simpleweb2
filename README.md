# Simple Shop - Static Starter

This repository contains a minimal static e‑commerce demo.

Pages added:
- index.html (Home)
- about.html (About Us)
- shop.html (Shop — product listing)
- contact.html (Contact form demo)

How to run locally:
1. Serve the project with a static server (e.g., `npx http-server` or `python -m http.server`).
2. Open http://localhost:8080

Notes: the shop page uses `products.json` and `script.js` for product rendering and cart functionality.
