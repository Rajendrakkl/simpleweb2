# Simple Shop - Static Starter

A minimal static e‑commerce demo using plain HTML/CSS/JS.

Features:
- Product listing from `products.json`
- Product detail modal
- Shopping cart persisted in `localStorage`
- Demo checkout (no payments)
- Responsive layout

How to run locally:
1. Clone the repo and switch to `main` (or the branch with these files).
2. Serve the folder with a static server (some browsers block fetch for local files):
   - `npx http-server` or
   - `python -m http.server`
3. Open `http://localhost:8080` (or the port your server shows).

Edit `products.json` to add or change products.
